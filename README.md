# About The Project
Manage Orders is a web application built with Next and Express. The app simulates a portal allowing users to create and update dummy orders.
- Installation of a third-party database is not required. Data is stored in a local object on the Express server.
- Simple interface design: column sorting, intuitive buttons, and paging.

For more information on how to build the Express backend, check out my blog post: [Everywhen Software Blog](https://www.everywhensoftware.com/blog/2023-09-01-Simple-Express/)
