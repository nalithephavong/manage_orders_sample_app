# About The Project
Manage Orders is a web application built with Next and Express. The app simulates a portal allowing users to create and update dummy orders.
- Installation of a third-party database is not required. Data is stored in a local object on the Express server.
- Simple interface design: column sorting, intuitive buttons, and paging.
